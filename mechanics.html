            <h1 class="text-center">How to Play:</h1>
            <p class="text-center">Welcome to [UNTITLED CARD GAME], this a standard turn-based game, made by Sam Ollero, Xyz Alino, and Tea paler, however, before you can play the game, you have to learn the rules first (Or not, we can’t control you). 

                The goal of this game is, naturally, to defeat the opponent A.K.A, the giant lizard sitting in front of your screen, and to defeat him, heed our words slayer.
                
                On the first turn, you can use whatever card you want, however, subsequent turns will randomise the cards that can be used, encouraging the use of strategies.
                
                In our game, both enemy and player have the same stats, 50hp and 50 armour. To win, you must deplete the enemy’s health to 0, and to lose, the enemy has to deplete your health to 0. The armour is something that’ll absorb damage until it’s broken, and when the armour is broken, the hp will start taking damage.
                
                Speaking of cards, you have five cards in your deck, each has their own uses, and we hope you can use them to their utmost advantage.
                
                Fireball - a card that deals no damage initially, however, it makes the enemy take subsequent damage for the next few turns.
                
                Freeze - a card that deals pitiful damage, however, by casting it, you freeze the enemy, lowering the amount of damage they deal to you.
                
                Patch - Missing health? No problem! The “patch” card will heal you for 10 health
                
                Shatter - a miscellaneous card used to, as the name suggests, shatter the enemy’s armour, reducing it to armour, allowing your other attacks to start damaging the enemy directly quicker
                
                Strike - your most damaging attack, dealing ten damage to the either the enemy’s armour or hp
                
                But beware traveller, for the beasts also have their own tricks up their sleeves:
                
                Shatter - does the same thing as your shatter, reduces your armour to nil
                
                Strike - does the same thing as your strike, dealing ten damage to either hp or armour
                
                Summon - the beast can seek help from it’s fellow kindred, it will deal 5 damage per turn to you, and the only known way to kill it is through FIRE
                
                Cast - The enemy casts it’s dark magic upon you dealing 5 damage and giving itself 10 armour
                
                Heal - does the same as your heal, increases hp by 10
                
                Now you’ve learned the secrets of both your cards and the enemy, you are prepared to battle, strap on your boots, grab your helmet, flourish your deck cards, and PRESS THAT PLAY BUTTON!</p>
